**Open-data platform for chemical ecotoxicity assessment**

OpenChemFacts is an open-data platform dedicated to the assessment of chemicals’ ecotoxicity 🐟.
It provides transparent, reproducible, and scientifically robust indicators derived from internationally recognized models and high-quality regulatory and scientific datasets.

## 🌍 Purpose and Vision

OpenChemFacts aims to make **ecotoxicity information on chemicals easier to access, compare, and reuse** for:

* environmental scientists and modelers
* regulators and policy makers
* LCA practitioners and sustainability experts
* NGOs, industry stakeholders, and consultants working on chemical risk and impact assessment

By combining curated open data with standardized characterization models, the platform helps users better understand the potential impacts of chemicals on ecosystems and supports evidence-based decision-making.


## 🧱 Core Pillars

OpenChemFacts is built around two main pillars:

### 1. **Data collection and harmonization**

We aggregate, clean, and harmonize ecotoxicity-relevant data from major regulatory and scientific sources, such as:

* US EPA ECOTOX database
* EU REACH registration dossiers
* OECD test guidelines and dossiers
* National and regional inventories

Our work focuses on:

* consistent identifiers and cross-dataset mappings
* harmonized units, endpoints, and species
* traceable data provenance and versioning

This ensures that all indicators rely on a coherent and well-documented data foundation.


### 2. **Ecotoxicity characterization**

OpenChemFacts computes ecotoxicity indicators using internationally recognized models, including:

* USEtox®
* Environmental Footprint 3.1 (EF 3.1)
* Other consensus methods developed under **UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative** frameworks

Our objectives are to:

* ensure methodological alignment with widely accepted approaches
* provide clearly documented assumptions and parameters
* enable fully reproducible calculations
* facilitate transparent comparison across chemicals


## 🔍 Key Features

* Centralized access to curated ecotoxicity data for a wide range of chemicals
* Harmonized datasets ready for modeling and integration into analytical tools
* Model-based indicators aligned with international guidelines
* Transparent documentation of data sources, methods, and uncertainties
* Open-data philosophy: results (and where possible underlying data) are openly available for reuse and verification

## 🤝 Openness and Collaboration

OpenChemFacts is an open and collaborative initiative.
We welcome contributions from researchers, regulators, method developers, and practitioners wishing to:

* suggest new data sources
* refine harmonization rules
* contribute or improve characterization models
* review methods, documentation, and assumptions
