# Code of Conduct - OpenChemFacts

By participating in OpenChemFacts, you agree to follow this code of conduct and to contribute to a collaborative, respectful, and rigorous environment.

## Our Values

We value:
- **Mutual respect**: Treat all contributors with kindness and consideration
- **Scientific rigor**: Maintain high standards in our work
- **Transparency**: Clearly document our methods and decisions
- **Collaboration**: Foster constructive exchanges and mutual support

## Interactions and Communication

- Communicate in a respectful and constructive manner
- Accept feedback and criticism positively
- Be open to different perspectives and levels of expertise
- In case of disagreement, prioritize dialogue and consensus-building

## Scientific and Technical Standards

Ecotoxicity assessment of chemical substances is a complex field that requires:

- **Scientific expertise**: Contributions must be based on solid scientific foundations and recognized methods
- **Methodological rigor**: Ensure you understand the models and methods used before proposing modifications
- **Documentation**: Clearly document your assumptions, data sources, and methodological choices

If you are uncertain about the scientific relevance of a contribution, feel free to open an issue to discuss before proposing a major change.

## Focus and Priorities

To maintain the quality and coherence of the project:

- **Focus on specific tasks**: Avoid overly broad modifications that could impact multiple aspects of the system
- **Alignment with the Roadmap**: Prioritize contributions that align with the priorities defined in the Roadmap (which will be established when enough contributors are active)
- **Coordination**: Before undertaking significant work, check that there are no conflicts with other ongoing contributions

## OpenData Principles

OpenChemFacts is committed to respecting open data principles:

- **Transparency**: All source data, methods, and calculations must be traceable and documented
- **Reproducibility**: Processes must be documented in a way that allows for the reproduction of results
- **Openness**: Results and, when possible, underlying data are made available for reuse and verification

Your contributions must respect these principles by ensuring appropriate traceability and documentation.

## Commitment

By contributing to OpenChemFacts, you agree to respect this code of conduct. Violations may result in appropriate measures, ranging from a reminder to exclusion from the community, depending on severity and recurrence.

For any questions or concerns regarding this code of conduct, contact the maintainers (currently: @albanfournier).
